The Healthcare sector has progressed by quantum leaps in the past few years. Hence, it is evident that this growth of the industry should be managed properly by all the hospital staff. This causes very little attention to patient monitoring level of the saline bottle and as well as close the saline tube comprising of air bubble to avoid air embolism when the bottle is about to get empty. Automation of the saline system is the need of hospitals. Saline is a basic thing used in every hospital to deliver drugs to the patient to cure them. Whenever saline is fed to the patient there is always a requirement of nurse and caretaker to monitor it. Due to inattentiveness of nurses towards saline or lack of patient to nurse ratio in the hospital causing aeroembolism which may lead to heart attack, stroke or respiratory failure. This paper “LOAD CELL based system,” monitors the saline bottle using Arduino which performs the logical operation and connects the system to GSM MODULE. Whenever the level of the saline reaches the pre-defined critical level, then the nurses, doctors will be alerted through the message and an indicator will glow to alert the nurse station. So, that fatal accidents through air embolism and further complication can be prevented.
